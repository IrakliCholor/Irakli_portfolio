    <p> This project is regarding the plastic waste problem on planet earth. There are various 3D scenes used to depict
the concept of pollution, as well as a slideshow of real-life images depicting the plastic waste on our planet.
There is also a background noise used to add more emotion.The general emotion I want to convey is my concern regarding the planet which is in a very bad condition as
well as itâ€™s getting worse every single day. I want the audience to answer the questions on their own and see
how they feel after it.
