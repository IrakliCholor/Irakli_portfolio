  <p>This is my audio assignment, which I called "Coming Home". The samples I used are walking, outside ambiance, and a doorbell. It's supposed to describe the act of coming home with sounds.</p>
    
<h3> My GIF Animation</h3>

    <p>I made this project using both 3D and photoshop. First I rendered the frames of a ball hitting a person and then created a GIF in photoshop.</p>

    <p>My animation project is called 'Coming To Life'. It is an abstract depiction of an imaginary object transitioning into a body. The idea is to artistically depict how molecules form an organism. For this project, I used 3D design as well as after effects. I built the composition in Cinema4d and then used AE for text and effects.</p>
